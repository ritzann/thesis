\section{Two-Dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform}

%Another source of artifact which needed to be resolved are the fringes which remain in the unwrapped phase. 
%A method that can remove this is filtering of the unwanted frequencies in the Fourier domain. 

The Fourier Transform (FT) of a complex signal is the spatial frequency distribution of that signal and can be expressed as the sum of sines and cosines of varying amplitudes \cite{Wahl1987}.
