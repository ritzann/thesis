\section{An overview of phase-shift profilometry}
\subsection{General description}

Three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques have a wide array of applications in medicine, manufacturing, entertainment, etc \cite{}. 
Its most common application is in the digital archiving of natural and cultural heritage sites and objects due to its non-invasive and non-contact approach \cite{Simon2013}. 

Several methods for digital 3D reconstruction have been developed for the past years. Among these methods, the structured light illumination technique, particularly phase-shift profilometry (PSP), has proven to be a simpler and cheaper yet promising method for 3D reconstruction of surfaces as compared to laser scanners and other expensive tools used in 3D imaging \cite{Zhang2002, Chrova200x}. 

PSP is a fast-acquisition 3D shape measurement measurement technique which provides high-resolution (pixel-rich) images appropriate for the study of small details in an object \cite{}. 
A PSP system consists of a projector used for projecting phase-shifted sinusoidal fringes onto the object and a camera for recording the fringe image \cite{}.

\subsection{Encountered problems in PSP}

Depending on the PSP system, an uncalibrated PSP have several artifacts which are carried out in the 3D reconstruction. 
In applications in digitization of petroglyphs in which rock art details have a very shallow depth of mostly less than 5 mm, the details are obstructed due to these artifacts, and in worst cases, they can no longer be retrieved from the unwrapped phase maps.

The aforementioned artifacts arise from optical and digital nonlinearities of both the projector and camera such as vignetting effect or nonflatness of field and inherent gamma. 
As a consequence, phase value at a particular image point may change resulting to a wrong depth or height perception of
the object upon phase retrieval.

Another source of artifact which need to be addressed are the projected sinusoidal fringes which are left behind in the unwrapped phase and causes reduction of observed details.

Lastly, phase unwrapping method for PSP is a crucial step as it gives the absolute phase for direct conversion to actual height (depth). For typical unwrapping of phase along one dimension, discontinuities may occur causing singularities \footnote{Singularities are points in 2D and lines in 3D which introduce sudden jumps in the phase map after phase unwrapping} to form in the phase maps.
Efficient phase unwrapping which operates in 2D must then be used so as not to generate these discontinuties. Quality-guided path unwrapping algorithm following a noncontinuos path by Herraez et al was used 

These artifacts combined greatly affect the quality of 3D reconstruction using PSP.
Hence, step-by-step calibration for removing these artifacts needs to be implemented in order to get the most detailed 3D reconstructions. 

\subsection{Related works}

Previous works on calibration of camera-projector pairs deal with them separately \cite{Fernandez2011}, removal of vignetting effect through per-pixel point correction\cite{Yu2004} or only for fixed camera settings \cite{Goldman}, and computing for the nonlinearity or gamma factor itself \cite{Wang2014, Baker2008}, etc. 
Such works prove to be either limited or complex methods for camera-projector pair calibration depending on the approach.

In the Philippines, as far as we know, PSP has been used twice for applications in the study and archiving of a heritage site and object. 

The first one was in 2010 wherein Vergara used PSP for the archiving of the Angono petroglyphs. 
In his thesis, he was able to reduce the artifacts introduced by the PSP system using low intensity fringe patterns to avoid the non-linear regions of the camera-projector pair and lessen the singularities by proposing a specified PSP system geometry. 

Szeâ€™s thesis (2012) focused on phase-to-height conversion to study the graving marks of Ticao stone using PSP but was not able to address the source of branch cuts. The novelty of this research relies on the easy-to-implement algorithms for the complete removal of artifacts and branch cuts which utilizes the response curves of the camera-projector pair for non-repetitive calibration, as well as a geometry-independent and mobile PSP set-up which we can easily use for in-situ experiments.

\section{Thesis Structure}

This thesis contains 7 chapters including the Introduction. PSP will be discussed in Chapter 2 and will show the schematic setup of a PSP system and the general algorithms used to extract the phase and actual height of the target object. 

Chapter 3 introduces the inherent gamma of projectors and camera, how it affects the quality of the unwrapped phase maps, and the processes done to correct which involve curve fitting and interpolation. 
Chapter 4 proposes different background subtraction techniques for the removal of vignetting effect in the unwrapped phase maps. 

Chapter 5 discusses the concept of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) filtering and how it is applied to the resulting phase maps to remove the sinudoidal fringe artifacts.
Chapter 6 shows the results of using the calibrated PSP method 

The summary of this thesis and recommendations for future work are presented in Chapter 7.


%The purpose of this thesis is two-fold: (1) to deliver an analysis of parallel computing specifically on a self-constructed computer cluster; and, (2) to provide an instruction manual for other researchers so that they can set up their own affordable HPC clusters.
