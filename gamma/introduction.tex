\section{Inherent Gamma of camera and projectors}


GAMMA DEFINITION

Cameras have inherent gamma which changes the appearance of a digital image. This is caused by image compression on the way files are saved (JPG, TIFF, etc.) while LCD projectors do gamma correction by displaying images with adjusted pixel intensities for more detailed and enhanced projected images \cite{gamma_correction}. 


These nonlinearities combined greatly affect the quality of 3D reconstruction using PSP.
