\section{Inherent Gamma of camera and projectors}

Gamma is an inherent property of digital imaging systems \cite{Wang2014}. It is defined by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
V_{out} = {V_{in}}^\gamma
\end{equation}
where $V_{out}$ is the output luminance value $V_{in}$ is the actual luminance value of each pixel in an image, and $\gamma$ is the gamma factor of the imaging system \cite{McHugh2014}. The gamma factor changes the appearance of a digital image as it reaches our eyes. Once the image is saved (JPG, TIFF, etc.), compression happens and gamma is already encoded in it \cite{Wang2014}.

A better explanation of gamma encoding is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gammafactor}. The original gradient is a 5-bit (32 levels) image which was encoded linearly and with gamma. The differences between the three are clearly observed in the manner of spacing of the gray levels.

LCD projectors also do gamma encoding by displaying images with adjusted pixel intensities for more detailed and enhanced projected images \cite{Li2011}. 

In a PSP setup, inherent gamma of both projector and camera combines and is encoded in the output images producing a nonlinear input-output curve. Corrections must then be done to remove the distortion introduced by gamma.
